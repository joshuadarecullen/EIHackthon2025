# Environmental Intelligence Hackathon 2025

This project Involved Multi-modal Met Office weather data. Which consisted of climate data (sea air pressure temperature, wet bulb temperature, and geo potential), and corresponding text descriptions of the data in the form of pdf reports. This required a substantial amount of processes in order to pre-process and collate climate data with the pdf data.

Then main model was a CLIP inspired, where we implemented a contrastive loss to allow the image encoder to learn the text associated with the climate data.
